## About Me

### Software Developer

I am a passionate and results-driven software developer with a strong background in API development and web applications. My experience also includes working as a Business Intelligence (BI) Developer, where I specialized in creating custom solutions leveraging ETLs and advanced reporting tools. I have a solid foundation in Python, SQL databases, and ETL pipelines, and I am continually improving my skills in crafting engaging and responsive front-end designs. My current focus is building robust applications using FastAPI while integrating seamless backend and frontend solutions.
